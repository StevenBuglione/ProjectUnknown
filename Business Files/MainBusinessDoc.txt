PROPOSED BUSINESS PROBLEM AND SOLUTION (FIRST DRAFT):

Problem: 
    Background:
    -----------
    A college-aged student applies for a large quanitity of jobs. 
    As the semester progresses, the student updates their resume and continues applying to jobs.
    The student is notified by an employer to attend an interview.

    The Problem:
    ------------
    1. The student does not know when the application was sent to the employer.
    2. The student does not know what information was sent on the resume the employer recieved.
    3. The student has no way to locate the resume that was originally sent.
    4. The student does not remember the reason for applying for the role. 
    5. The student does not remember the exact role that was applied to, and it's description. 
    
    The Solution:
    -------------
    Geared towards a prospective graduate, the solution is based on allowing a user to track their job applications.
    What solves the problem?
        When a user applies for a job, the data submitted should include:
            - Job Title 
                Include option to add the role's description via txt or image upload. 
            - Employer Name 
            - Origin of Opportunity: 
                Recruiter, 
                Website, 
                Other,
                etc.. 

                Allow user to add recruiter's name, website, etc. 
            - Date of submission 
            - Resume: 
                File name, 
                Version (if applicable)
                Content (memory management could be issue)
                
                Include ability to view/download.

            - ~Insert any additional possible input values 
    
    User should be able to preform CRUD operations on their records. 

    Conclusion and Takeaways:
    ---------------------
    The functionality should allow the user to resolve the problem presented.

    Additional functionalities proposed:
        - Search functionality - Job related results filtered from search engine 
        - User profile customization - To be determined...
        - Possibility to link external account upon sign-up/login (via API)

    Although the proposed solution is targetting a college-aged student, the solution should be 
    able to be applicable to any user seeking employment with the desire to track progress. 

    Modernitiy needs to be prioritized in every possible business decision such as:
        - Business name,
        - Application title,
        - UI Design,
        - Website URL,
        etc.
    
    Security measures need to be adhered to strictly, mindful of this, the following should be considered:
        - Dependencies are a major source of scan results (various versions of plug-ins can be found to be vulnerable).
        - Every dependency and their dependent dependencies need to be annoted and grouped in the pom.xml via comments.
        - Coding practices will need to be outlined and followed. 
        - Vulnerabilities can exist on the UI, an third developer will need to be provided relavent documentation.
    

    This is only a first draft. Once official names are established, this document will be transitioned to 
    more formal documentation.
